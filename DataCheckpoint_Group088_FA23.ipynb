    "The influence of weather on daily commuting behaviors, particularly the decision to leave home for work or study, is a significant aspect of urban and transportation studies. Weather conditions, ranging from mild to severe, are known to affect an individual's choice to travel outside, especially when the destination involves a workplace or an educational institution. This is exemplified by studies that have shown a decrease in outdoor activities, such as exercise and recreation, during adverse weather conditions​​</a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)​.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, research using mobile phone GPS data indicates that weather parameters like temperature and rainfall influence daily activity patterns, affecting decisions regarding destinations and time spent outside</a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)​. This correlation suggests that similar weather-related patterns could be observed in the context of academic institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where library usage is an integral part of academic life, understanding how weather impacts foot traffic is essential. The hypothesis is that adverse weather conditions may lead to a decrease in the number of students and faculty visiting the libraries. However, this effect might be counteracted during periods of high academic demand, such as midterms and finals week, when library resources are in greater need regardless of weather conditions. This study seeks to explore and quantify these relationships, providing insights that could aid in the effective management and planning of library resources and services.\n",

    "We got this dataset from a UCSD librarian [Deborah Kegel](mailto:dkegel@ucsd.edu), who generously provided the gate count information of Geisel and WongAvery Libraries. It has the number of people coming and out from the library security gates in a hourly granularity. Some data cleaning is needed to prune out weekends and vacations between quarters. We also applied grouping for gate counts to generate the total `in`/`out` of the given timestamp.\n",

Many conversions is needed as the data is logged in a unusual format, see [here](https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-data/how-we-process-integrated-surface-database-historical-weather-data/). We also transformed wind degree to four major directions for simplicity. \n",
